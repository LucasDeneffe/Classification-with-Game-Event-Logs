# Classification-with-Game-Event-Logs

Before using this repository, two zip files need to be extracted. These had to be inserted due to github's 100MB limit on files:
1. Extract 'Arrays.rar' in Data collection/Arrays
2. Extract 'Models.rar' in Models

To replicate the data colllection, the following steps need to be taken:
1. Run `ScrapeReplays.py`
2. Extract the zip files scraped in Data collection/replays
3. Connect Data collection/replays to DataMaker.py
